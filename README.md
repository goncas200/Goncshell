# goncshell


I made a small shell with C++

This shell adds two codes:

   compilec (filename.c) - compiles a C file and makes a .exe file with the same name (gcc is required)
   compilec++ (filename.cpp) - compiles a C++ file and makes a .exe file with the same name (g++ is required)

I hope you like my shell :)
